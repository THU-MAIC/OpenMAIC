/**
 * What the material library's organizing routes share: the gate, reading a
 * JSON body, and their answers. The routes are thin: they resolve the
 * request's owner and call the shared operations in
 * `lib/persistence/material-library.ts` with the request fence, so a retired
 * owner is refused (403) and a busy one asked to retry (503).
 *
 * A refusal the page can act on is `{ success: false, errorCode, error,
 * reason }`, `reason` being the operation's own status (`name_taken`,
 * `not_empty`, ...). A folder or material that is missing or another owner's
 * answers the plain 404 every agent-runtime route uses, so the answer says
 * nothing about another owner's ids.
